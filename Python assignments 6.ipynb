    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit characteristics from other objects."

    "1- OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- It is good for defining abstract data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Implementation details are hidden from other modules and other modules has a clearly defined interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "4- It is easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "5- Objects, methods, instance, message passing, inheritance are some important properties provided by these particular languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "6- Encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction are also counts in these fundamentals of programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "7- It implements real life scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "8- In OOP, programmer not only defines data types but also deals with operations applied for data structures."
